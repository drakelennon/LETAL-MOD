Letal++ Mod is a difficulty overhaul mod for State Of Decay 2 Nightmare Zone, inspired in some other mods and much new stuff to make the game harder and funnier.
I wanted to make this mod because, in my opinion, nightmare zone is too easy, lethal zone is lacking some fun and my friends and I were lacking some challenge.
Letal++ Zone is designed to be played by 2-4 EXPERT players.
Some modifications were made to help the player deal with this higher difficulty, like starting with a gun and crouch sprinting enabled, etc.

WARNINGS:
- DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS IN THIS MOD ALSO AFFECT CLIENTS, DON'T INVITE RANDOM PEOPLE TO YOUR GAME!!!
- IN THIS DIFFICULTY YOUR CHARACTERS WILL POTENTIALLY DIE. THIS MODE IS DESIGNED TO EMPHASIZE THAT YOU ARE SURVIVING A F**** APOCALIPSE! NOT LIVING ON A HOLIDAY.
- Letal++ IS DESIGNED TO WORK ONLY ON LETHAL ZONE, I DIDN'T TEST IT ON OTHER ZONES, SO IT MAY HAVE SOME BUGS.

Here is what Letal++ Mod changes in the game:

Special Thanks to: 
LuSka, Pekenoxd, Iron and Ov√£o and the Official French SOD2 Discord for testing this mod.


In my opinion, mods are no intellectual property, they are just edits of a present game file
made BY the community FOR the community, to give credits for using other modder assets is OK
but WE OWN NOTHING.

You can use my assets as you wish, and I will use yours.
I'm always OK when the community wins. MY BIG F YOU TO ALL MODDERS WHO THINK THEY ARE GODS.
Peace!
