InfernalMod is a difficulty overhaul mod for State Of Decay 2 Nightmare Zone, inspired in some other mods and much new stuff to make the game harder and funnier.
I wanted to make this mod because, in my opinion, nightmare zone is too easy, lethal zone is lacking some fun and my friends and I were lacking some challenge.
Infernal Zone is designed to be played by 2-4 GOOD players.
Some modifications were made to help the player deal with this higher difficulty, like starting with a gun and crouch sprinting enabled, etc.

WARNINGS:
- DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS IN THIS MOD ALSO AFFECT CLIENTS, DON'T INVITE RANDOM PEOPLE TO YOUR GAME!!!
- IN THIS DIFFICULTY YOUR CHARACTERS WILL POTENTIALLY DIE. THIS MODE IS DESIGNED TO EMPHASIZE THAT YOU ARE SURVIVING A F**** APOCALIPSE! NOT LIVING ON A HOLIDAY.
- INFERNALMOD IS DESIGNED TO WORK ONLY ON LETHAL ZONE, I DIDN'T TEST IT ON OTHER ZONES, SO IT MAY HAVE SOME BUGS.

Here is what InfernalMod changes in the game:

- No Peaceful Start: All Freaks and Blood Freaks will spawn right from the start of the game

Special Thanks to: 
LuSka, Pekenoxd, Iron and Ovão and the Official French SOD2 Discord for testing this mod.


In my opinion, mods are no intellectual property, they are just edits of a present game file
made BY the community FOR the community, to give credits for using other modder assets is OK
but WE OWN NOTHING.

You can use my assets as you wish, and I will use yours.
I'm always OK when the community wins. MY BIG F YOU TO ALL MODDERS WHO THINK THEY ARE GODS.
Peace!
